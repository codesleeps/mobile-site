Check for any injuries to yourself or your passengers.
If it's a minor collision and there are no injuries, make a note of it just in case the other people later try to claim for an injury.
Call the police and an ambulance immediately if anyone is hurt or if the road is blocked.
Try to remain as calm as possible – its normal to be shaken after an accident, take a few deep breaths and try to take stock of the situation the best you can. And don't lose your temper.
